# Manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data
By conducting an exploratory data analysis using the data downloaded from DataCamp Learn, we aim to determine whether the duration of Netflix movies has decreased over time.

Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry.
